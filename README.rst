A unifhy-compliant version of the rainfall-runoff model Alpine 1
========================================================================

The Alpine1 model (`Eder et al., 2003`_) is a bucket-type rainfall-runoff model.

Alpine1 is a simply conceptual rainfall-runoff model originally
developed for use in the Austrian Alps (`Eder et al., 2003`_).
It contains a simple degree-day-based snow accumulation and melt
model, coupled to a basic representation of the soil column. The
soil column is modelled as a simple bucket with evaporation, 
surface runoff and baseflow processes. The version used here is 
derived from the MARRMoT database (`Knoben et al., 2019`_).
